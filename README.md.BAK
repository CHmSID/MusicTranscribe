# My Project Title

This is a template for CA400 projects.  Please read these instructions carefully.

This file is written in
[markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).  Markdown
is a suitable format for documents stored in git repositories.

## Instructions

You *must* do the following:

1 - Fork this repo.

2 - Rename your fork using the format

    2017-ca400-USERNAME

replacing `USERNAME` with your School of Computing login name.

For example, if Stephen Blott were to be doing a fourth-year project, he would rename
his repo as:

 2017-ca400-sblott

You can rename your repo by selecting *Edit Project* from the drop-down menu
(with a gear icon) on the top right of your project's home page.  Change the
*Project name* field.

You should also update the *Project description*.

3 - This directory has two sub-directories.

- All of your source code should be placed in the `src` sub-directory.

- All of your documentation should be placed in the `docs` sub-directory.

4 - There is further important documentation in the `docs` directory.  Read that next.

When you are have followed all of these instructions and are sure that you
understand what is expected, you may replace the contents of this file with a
brief description of your project (two or three paragraphs).
